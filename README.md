## Helper Functions

This is mainly for me: I wanted a quick way to access the helper functions that I use, mainly within my templater and dataview scripts. Tempalter does provide a scripts folder, but I wanted something a bit different:

- multiple functions within a single JavaScript file.
- Helper "aliasing", so they aren't as deeply nested.

## Installation

Download the latest release. Extract and put `main.js` and `manifest.json` in `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/helpers`.
